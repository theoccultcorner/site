Are you called to serve?

Today Independent Catholics of all ages are being called to a life of service and witness in the church. 
The Gnostic Catholic Union Seminary is preparing students to answer that call.  

We, at the Gnostic Catholic Union Seminary, in addition to offering several certificate programs offer bachelor, master, and doctoral level degrees at very reasonable tuition. Education to help you build your ministry should be affordable and easily accessible.

We are pleased to announce our Degree by Dissertation / Thesis Program.  Although this model of learning can be done in a shorter amount of time compared to the traditional coursework method, it is by no means less taxing.  These programs are rigorous but just as rewarding as the result is a work of publishable quality and depth.
